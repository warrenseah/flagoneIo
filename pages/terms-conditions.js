            servers and/or any and all information stored therein; (iv) any
            interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the service;
            (v) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be
            transmitted to or through the service by any third party; (vi) any
            errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage
            incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, transmitted,
            or otherwise made available through the service; and/or (vii) the

            In no event shall flagone (and its respective officers, directors,
            employees, members, agents, and affiliates) be liable for any
            direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, or consequential
            damages or damages for lost profits, arising out of, or in any way
            connected with, your access to or use of the service or with the
            delay or inability to access, display, or use the service; any
            computer viruses, information, software, linked services, products,
            and services obtained through the service; or otherwise arising out
            of the access to or use of the service whether based on a theory of
            negligence, contract, tort, strict liability, or otherwise, and even
            if flagone has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In
            no event shall flagone (and its respective officers, directors,
            employees, members, agents, and affiliates) be liable to you for any
            claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or
            costs in excess of $100.00. The limitation of liability reflects the
            allocation of risk between the parties. The limitations specified in
            this section will survive and apply even if any limited remedy
            specified in these terms is found to have failed of its essential
            purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
            incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or
            exclusions may not apply to you. This agreement gives you specific
            legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from
            state to state. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of
            liability under this agreement will not apply to the extent
            prohibited by applicable law.
